# Agile Coach and Trainer
## SUMMARY
#### Agile Coach:
I structure and deliver Agile transformations in large institutions. I bring to my coaching practice expertise as a working Scrum Master. I am methodology-agnostic, using ideas from Scrum, XP, Kanban, SAFE and Lean Start-up as appropriate.
#### Agile Course Author and Trainer: 
I conduct in-house and delegate training sessions on Agile project management. I prepare all materials, exercises and collateral. Recently wrote an Agile Foundation Certificate course which has been certified by the British Computer Society(BCS). The course relies entirely on activities, discussion and reflection as training methods rather than traditional presentations.

Agile coaching, Certified Scrum Master, Kanban, Java software development, Test Driven Development(TDD), Continuous Integration (Git, GitHub, JUnit, Jenkins, Bamboo, BDD, Cucumber, Gherkin) working with on-shore, off-shore and distributed development teams.
